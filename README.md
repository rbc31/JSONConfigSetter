# JSONConfigSetter


This project attempts to create a library to allow small programs have user editable data.

The library works by taking a JSON file and allowing the parameters in the file to be edited in a JAVA swing interface.

Currently you can create, edit and delete objects, arrays, ints, booleans, doubles and strings
